# Oli Password Generator

Summary

This Python project demonstrates how to create a secure, customizable password generator. The program allows users to specify the total length of the password, the number of symbols, and the number of numbers included. Using Python’s built-in random module, the program generates a strong, randomized password that combines letters, symbols, and numbers based on the user’s preferences.

Features

- Customizable Password Length: Users can define the total number of characters in the password.
- Symbol and Number Inclusion: Allows specifying the count of symbols and numbers to include in the password.
- Randomization: Shuffles the selected characters to ensure randomness and enhance security.

 Code Breakdown

1. Importing Required Module

The program imports the random module, which is essential for generating random samples and shuffling the password elements.

2. Defining Helper Functions

a. lists()

This function initializes and returns three lists:
- num_list: A list of numeric characters (0–9).
- symbols_list: A list of common symbols used in passwords.
- char_list: A list of lowercase alphabetic characters (a–z).

 b. list_processing()

This function processes the user’s input to generate a password:

1.Input Parameters:
- char_list, symbols_list, num_list: Lists containing the available characters.
- char_limit, num_symbols, num_count: User-defined counts for letters, symbols, and numbers.
 
2. Random Selection:
- Uses random.sample() to randomly select characters from the lists based on user specifications.
 
3. Merge and Shuffle:
- Combines all selected elements into a single list.
- Shuffles the combined list using random.shuffle() to enhance randomness.

4. Password Generation:
- Converts the shuffled list into a string using ''.join().

3. Main Function

The main() function serves as the program’s entry point:

1. User Input:
- Collects the desired total length of the password, the number of symbols, and the number of numbers.
- Validates that the sum of symbols and numbers does not exceed the total password length.
2. List Initialization:
- Calls the lists() function to retrieve character, symbol, and number lists.
3. Password Generation:
- Calls list_processing() to generate the password based on the user’s preferences.
4. Output:
- Prints the generated password.
